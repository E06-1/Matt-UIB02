    <h2>Amon Amarth</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Amon Amarth </b> is a Swedish melodic death metal band from Tumba,
        formed in 1992. The band takes its name from the Sindarin name of Mount
        Doom, a volcano in J. R. R. Tolkien′s Middle-earth. Their lyrics mostly
        deal with Viking mythology and history, and so they have been linked with
        Viking metal, although the band themselves prefer to be referred to as
        melodic death metal.
    </p>
    <p>
        The band is composed of lead guitarist Olavi Mikkonen, vocalist Johan
        Hegg, bassist Ted Lundström, rhythm guitarist Johan Söderberg, and drummer
        Jocke Wallgren. Amon Amarth has released eleven studio albums, one
        compilation album, one EP, one video album, and ten music videos. Their
        first studio album, Once Sent from the Golden Hall, debuted in 1998. Five
        more studio releases followed, before the band saw its breakthrough with
        the 2008 album Twilight of the Thunder God, which debuted at No. 10 on the
        Swedish album charts and No. 50 on the US Billboard 200. Four more albums,
        Surtur Rising, Deceiver of the Gods, Jomsviking, and Berserker followed in
        2011, 2013, 2016, and 2019 respectively.

    <h2>history</h2>
    <h3>Formation (1988–1991)</h3>

    <p>The band emerged from the previous death metal band Scum, founded in 1988 by Paul "Themgoroth" Mäkitalo (Dark
        Funeral) on vocals, Olavi Mikkonen on lead guitar, Petri Tarvainen on bass and Vesa Meriläinen rhythm guitar.

    <h3>Early recordings (1992–1997)</h3>

    <p>After a 1991 demo, Scum broke up and Amon Amarth formed in 1992. Hegg replaced Mäkitalo on vocals, Anders Hansson
        joined on guitar, and Ted Lundström replaced Tarvainen on bass, before recording its first demo Thor Arise
        (1993). Raw and uneven in sound and execution, it was never officially released due to low quality
        standards,[1][2] but the band caught the attention of extreme metal fans with its own "infectious brand of
        epic-sounding brutality and unadorned conviction".[1] In 1994 another demo entitled The Arrival of the Fimbul
        Winter was recorded; this time 1,000 copies were indeed issued.

        In 1996, they signed with Pulverised Records, on which they released their first MCD, Sorrow Throughout the Nine
        Worlds, which sold 6000 copies.</p>
    </p>

    <h3>Signed with Metal Blade (1998–2007)
    </h3>
    <p>They then signed with Metal Blade Records which released the debut album Once Sent from the Golden Hall.
        Described as "a compelling fusion of buzzsaw riff work, melodic harmonies and soul-crushing rhythms punctuated
        by Hegg's callous black/death roar and accounts of Norse battles and treachery" it made sure Amon Amarth's
        popularity rose internationally.[1] According to Allmusic, the song that bore the group's namesake was the most
        memorable, containing "the chaotic noises of battle, the screams of the dying, and much sword-clashing to
        boot."[4] Since then they have performed at multiple Canada and US tours, festival appearances, eight music
        videos, and appearances in over 100 metal magazines.</p>

    <p>In June 1998, as the band was about to commence a tour alongside Deicide, Six Feet Under and Brutal Truth,
        guitarist Anders Hansson left and was replaced by Johan Soderberg. After the tour Martin Lopez quit to join
        Opeth[4] and Fredrik Andersson (ex-A Canorous Quintet) came in. With him in Spring 1999 the band recorded and
        released its second full-length, The Avenger. The release was supported by the X-Mas Massacre Festivals Tour
        with Morbid Angel headlining</p>

    <p>The Crusher, released in 2001, was considered[according to whom?] to be its most aggressive album. In support of
        it the band went on tour with Marduk and Vader, taking part in No Mercy Festival. its first American tour in
        autumn 2001 though had to be cancelled (due to the September 11 attacks) and was held later, in January 2002,
        without Marduk, Amon Amarth headlining. In April 2002 the band toured Europe with Vomitory and in August
        performed at Wacken Open Air before 12.000 metal fans. In Berno Studio in Malmo Versus The World was recorded
        and came out, The Viking Edition comprising a bonus CD which included demos Thor Arise and Arrival Of The Fimbul
        Winter. Touring continued up until Spring 2004 when the band started working on Fate of Norns album which was
        released on 6 September 2004.[3] The follow-up, With Oden on Our Side (2006), has shown (according to AllMusic)
        that "Amon Amarth continue to be champions of the worldwide death metal tournament"[5] and rose to number 26 in
        the US Top Independent album charts.[6] The album's material though was not included in the DVD Wrath Of The
        Norsemen (the song of the same title would be found in the 2011 album)[7] which was released in May 2006, having
        turned gold in US (platinum - in Canada) ever since.</p>
    <p>In early January 2008, its first tour of Australia and New Zealand took place, supporting Dimmu Borgir, after
        finishing a US and Canadian tour with Sonic Syndicate and Himsa.</p>

    <h3>Renewed contract with Metal Blade (2008–2014)</h3>
    <p>Amon Amarth extended its record deal with Metal Blade Records for three more albums.[9] After extending its
        record deal, the band released Twilight of the Thunder God, which featured guest appearances by Lars-Göran
        Petrov of Entombed, Roope Latvala of C</div>
    <p>Amon Amarth embarked on a North American headlining tour in October 2008, with support from Ensiferum, Belphegor,
        and The Absence.[11] In 2009 the band returned to the States for another successful series of dates with
        Goatwhore, Skeletonwitch and Lazarus AD and later in 2010 with Holy Grail and Eluveitie. In between, Amon Amarth
        were named "Best Breakthrough Act" at Metal Hammer's prestigious Golden Gods Awards.[3] The band also supported
        Slayer in its Unholy Alliance Chapter III European tour. Amon Amarth played its first show in India, headlining
        the Deccan Rock Festival in Bangalore on 5 December 2009.</p>

    <p>On 30 November 2010, Amon Amarth confirmed its next album entitled Surtur Rising would be released in Spring
        2011.[13] The drums were recorded at Park Studios, while bass and guitars were recorded at Fascination Street
        Studios.[14] On 27 January 2011 Metal Blade Records released the new album's first single, titled "War of the
        Gods", on YouTube. On 29 March 2011, Surtur Rising was released in North America.[citation needed] To support
        the album, the band embarked on a 4-month world tour with Children Of Bodom and Ensiferum, among others.

        Amon Amarth performed at Wacken Open Air in 2012,[15] Hellfest 2013, Download Festival 2013, Sweden Rock
        Festival and Mayhem Festival 2013.</p>

    <p>On 25 June 2013 Amon Amarth released its ninth studio album, Deceiver of the Gods. The album cover, according to
        the band, depicted Ragnarök the last battle between the Æsir gods and Loki, accompanied by the army of the dead.
