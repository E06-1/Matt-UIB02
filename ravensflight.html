    <h1>Ravens flight</h1>
    <p>
      As the first light touched the waves And the ravens cawed across the bay A
      mighty fleet with red white sails Three hundred viking ships were on their
      way War!
    </p>
    <p>
      With thirst for blood and all-out war A thirst that's aching through our
      hearts and bones We're heading west to distant shores To avenge our father
      and to win the throne
    </p>
    <p>
      They think their god will save their skin But all resistance will be in
      vain We stare at death with crimson grins With Odin's help we cannot fail
    </p>
    <p>
      We hold our heads up to the sky And know that we will never die As long as
      we stand side by side As long as we can see the ravens fly Ravens fly!
      Ravens fly! War!
    </p>
    <p>
      Heading to Northumbraland Come what may, we won't back down When horns of
      war begin to sound Aella's head will lose its crown
    </p>
    <p>
      Come what may, we hold our heads up to the sky And know that we will never
      die As long as Odin's on our side
    </p>
    <p>
      We hold our heads up to the sky And know that we will never die As long as
      we stand side by side As long as we can see the ravens fly Ravens fly!
      Ravens fly!
    </p>
    <p>
      We hold our heads up to the sky And know that we will never die As long as
      we stand side by side As long as we can see the ravens fly
    </p>
    <p>
      We hold our heads up to the sky And know that we will never die As long as
      we stand side by side As long as we can see the ravens fly
    </p>
    <p>Ravens fly! See the ravens fly!</p>
