    <h1>Ravens flight lyrics</h1>
    <p>
      They have gathered on these plains Prepared to meet our steel All their
      efforts are in vain We will crush them! We will make them kneel!
    </p>
    <p>
      War! Here to conquer! Battle ready! No retreat! War! Here to conquer!
      Battle ready! No retreat!
    </p>
    <p>
      Vikings! Raise the shield wall! Hold the front line! Fight 'til death!
    </p>
    <p>
      Vikings! Raise the shield wall! Hold the front line! Fight 'til death!
    </p>
    <p>
      Vikings! Raise the shield wall! Hold the front line! Fight 'til death!
    </p>
    <p>
      A chain is never stronger than its weakest link We'll hold this wall
      together Our hearts will never sink
    </p>
    <p>Warfare! Honour! Glory! Death! Warfare! Honour! Glory! Death!</p>
    <p>
      Here they come, a vain attack Our lines will never break We'll stand our
      ground and send them back We will put their heads on stakes!
    </p>
    <p>
      War! Here to conquer! Battle ready! No retreat! War! Here to conquer!
      Battle ready! No retreat!
